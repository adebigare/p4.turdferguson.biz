Project 4 for dwa15 Harvard Extension

1-2 paragraph description of your application- 

  My application is loosely a Pinterest for news. Users can create Timelines around a theme, and then they or other users can add links to the Timeline to build a rich narrative. While the project is nowhere near realizing this vision, some basic architecture is in place. 

A bulleted list of features your application includes- 

- Follow Users
- Upload Profile Image
- Edit Profile
- Add links to timelines
- create timelines
- follow users
- Incorporates the Embedly API to style links

What aspects of your application are being managed by JavaScript
- JQuery's form plugin manages adding links to the timeline
- Jquery Masonry handles the layout (poorly. I would never recommend using it). 
- Embedly styling is handled through jquery
- 
Any additional information the graders may need to know about using your app (for example, if certain features can only be seen by an admin, provide test admin credentials)

My apologies for the less than spectacular layout. As mentioned previously, Masonry has been abhorrently difficult to coerce into usefulness.
